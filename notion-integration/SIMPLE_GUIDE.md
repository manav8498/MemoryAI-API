## 🎯 How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Your Notion    │  (All accessible pages/databases)
│  Workspace      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ auto_sync_all.py discovers & syncs
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  Memory AI API  │  (Stores + Indexes everything)
│  Vector Search  │  ├─ Postgres: Metadata
│  Knowledge Graph│  ├─ Milvus: Vector embeddings
└────────┬────────┘  └─ Neo4j: Relationships
         │
         │ chat.py searches
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│  You ask        │  "What jobs have I applied to?"
│  questions      │  → Searches ALL 27 pages
│  naturally!     │  → Returns relevant results
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Point:** Memory AI is doing:
- Vector similarity search (semantic understanding)
- BM25 search (keyword matching)
- Hybrid ranking (combining both)
- All in ~300-500ms per query
