# 2. Set your OpenAI key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key-here'

# 3. Run the quick test
python3.11 langchain_quickstart.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Authentication
- ✅ Memory storage
- ✅ Memory recall
- ✅ LangChain agent integration

**Expected time:** 1-2 minutes

---

### Option 2: Comprehensive Testing (10 Minutes)

Run the full test suite to validate all features:

```bash
# 1. Set your OpenAI key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key-here'

# 2. Run comprehensive tests
python3.11 test_langchain_integration.py
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Authentication & Setup (register/login)
- ✅ Collection Management
- ✅ Memory Storage (user info, preferences)
- ✅ Memory Recall (name, work, preferences)
- ✅ Complex Reasoning (multi-fact synthesis)
- ✅ Conversation Continuity
- ✅ Memory Persistence

**Expected time:** 3-5 minutes

**Output includes:**
- Step-by-step test results
- Success/failure indicators
- Detailed statistics
- Next steps recommendations

---

### Option 3: Interactive Chatbot (Ongoing Testing)

Test with real conversations:

```bash
# 1. Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key'
export MEMORY_API_EMAIL='your@email.com'
export MEMORY_API_PASSWORD='your-password'

# 2. Run the chatbot
python3.11 langchain_chatbot_example.py

# 3. Chat naturally!
# Type 'quit' to exit, 'stats' for statistics
```

**What you can test:**
- Real conversations with memory
- Multi-turn dialogue
- Memory persistence across sessions
- Complex queries
- User preferences

**Interactive commands:**
- `quit` or `exit` - Stop the chatbot
- `clear` - Clear conversation history

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "OPENAI_API_KEY not set"

**Symptom:**
```
❌ OPENAI_API_KEY not set!
```

**Solution:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-actual-key'

# Or pass inline:
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...' python3.11 langchain_quickstart.py
```

---

### Issue 2: "Memory API not accessible"

**Symptom:**
```
❌ Memory API not accessible at http://localhost:8000
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if running
docker-compose ps

# If not running, start it
docker-compose up -d

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

---

### Issue 3: "No module named 'langchain'"

**Symptom:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-core tiktoken
```

---

### Issue 4: "Agent loops without finishing"

**Symptom:**
Agent keeps thinking but doesn't respond

**Solution:**
This is usually normal - the agent is:
1. Searching memory
2. Deciding what to store
3. Formatting response

If it takes > 30 seconds, check:
- OpenAI API is responding
- Memory API is responding
- max_iterations isn't too high

---

### Issue 5: "No relevant memories found"

**Symptom:**
Search returns empty results

**Solutions:**
1. Wait a few seconds after storing (indexing delay)
2. Check query matches stored content
3. Verify correct collection_id
4. Try searching with empty query to see all memories

```python
# Debug: List all memories
memories = memory_client.search_memories("", limit=100)
print(f"Total memories: {len(memories)}")
for m in memories:
    print(f"  - {m['content']}")
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Verbose Mode
```python
# See what the agent is thinking
AgentExecutor(..., verbose=True)
```

### Tip 2: Check Logs
```bash
# API logs
docker-compose logs -f api

# See what's happening
```

### Tip 3: Test Incrementally
```python
# Test each component separately
1. Test auth ✓
2. Test memory storage ✓
3. Test memory search ✓
4. Test agent ✓
```

### Tip 4: Monitor Token Usage
```python
# OpenAI dashboard shows token usage
# Optimize by:
# - Using gpt-4o-mini instead of gpt-4
# - Reducing max_iterations
# - Limiting memory search results
```
